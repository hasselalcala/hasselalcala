# üë©‚Äçüíª About me
I am a highly skilled professional with a Ph.D. in Computer Science specializing in Wireless Sensor Networks, stochastic modeling (Markov Chains), cryptography, and cybersecurity. Over the years, I have developed expertise in Rust programming and blockchain technologies, particularly the NEAR Protocol. I have a passion for research and innovation in zero-knowledge proofs, decentralized applications (dApps), and scalable smart contract solutions.
