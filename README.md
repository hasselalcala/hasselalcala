# About me
Ph.D. focused on Wireless Sensor Networks, mathematical model using stochastic model as Markov chain, cybersecurity, electromagnetic energy harvesting systems, antenna theory and design at 2.4GHz using CST Studio Suite, Cognitive Radio, Medium Access Control protocols such as Non-Persistent Carrier-Sense Multiple Access (NP-CSMA) and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), discrete-event simulations using C/C++, and performance evaluation of wireless networks. My qualities are adaptability, teamwork and fast learning skills, self-learning and problem-solving ability, analysis capacity, ability to teach, honesty, and responsible. Passionate about research in zero-knowledge proof, mathematics, teaching, and learning Cairo/Sta.

# Workshops

- **Participant in the Women Build Web3 community workshop "30 Days of Web3".** In this workshop I adquire the knowledge and skills needed to build my own dApps on Ethereum.
    -  I build create a full-stack RSVP dapp. I learn how to build with this stack on Ethereum: Filecoin & IPFS, The Graph, Radicle, Infura, Polygon and Lens.
       -  [Smart contract repository](https://github.com/hasselalcala/web3rsvp)
       -  [Subgraph repository](https://github.com/hasselalcala/web3rsvp-subgraph-code)
       -  [Frontend repository](https://github.com/hasselalcala/web3RSVP-frontend-starter)
       -  [Lens repository](https://github.com/hasselalcala/lens-api-starter)
- **Participant in the StarkNet Basecamp.** This workshop provide an in-depth training on the internals of zero-knowledge proof systems, Cairo Language, and StarkNet with the objective that I can go on to effectively train others on these subjects.

# Hackathons
- *ethBerlin.* [ProofID](https://github.com/hasselalcala/proofID). Is a credibility soul bounded token that allows people to proof their financial status to 3rd party entities using zero knowledge. With ProofID you can make your data your own. Protecting your personal information is our top priority, with ProofID to take the control back to your hands.

- *Starkware Hacker House.* [WTF Academy Starknet](https://github.com/hasselalcala/WTF-Academy-StarkNet-Hackathon). WTF Academy is a web3 open-source university aiming to onboard 10,000 developers to web3 space. After you complete the courses that we offer, you can claim your SBT certificate.
